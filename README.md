# CalculatorGUI
This is my first application - Calculator.
It works only with whole numbers. It is written in Java and I used Swing (collection of user interface components) to make it.
Please don't judge me, for now that's my first try :). 
It have the basics commands - "+", "-", "*", "/" and "C".

To start the application:
1. Download code.
2. Open in InteliJ IDEA or another IDE.
3. Run "Calculator GUI"
